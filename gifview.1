.TH GIFVIEW 1 "11 July 2017" "Version \*V"
.SH NAME
gifview \- displays GIF images and animations on the X window system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gifview
\%[\fB--display\fP \fIdisplay\fP]
\%[options]
\%[filenames and frames].\|.\|.
'
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gifview
displays GIF image files on workstations and terminals running the X Window
System.
.B gifview
understands multi-image GIFs, which can be displayed either as slideshows
or as animations.
'
.SH INTERACTION
.B gifview
windows recognize several keystrokes and button commands. Many of them are
only useful for multi-image GIFs.
.TP 12
.RB "Space or " n
'
Go to the next frame.
.TP
.BR b " or " p
Go to the previous frame.
.TP
.BR r " or " <
Go to the first frame.
.TP
.BR >
Go to the last frame.
.TP
ESC
Stop the animation.
.TP
.BR s " or " a
Toggle between animation and slideshow mode.
.TP
.BR u
Toggle between normal and unoptimized mode.
.TP
Backspace
'
Delete this window.
.TP
.B q
Quit
.BR gifview .
'
.PP
Left-clicking on a window goes to the next frame; right-clicking on a
window deletes that window.
'
.SH COMMAND LINE

.BR gifview 's
command line consists of
.IR "GIF input files"
and
.IR options .
Most options start with a dash (\-) or plus (+); frame selections, a kind
of option, start with a number sign (#). Anything else is a GIF input file.
.PP
.B gifview
displays one window for each GIF input file you specify. If no GIF input
file is given, or you give the special filename `\-', it reads from the
standard input.
'
.SH OPTIONS

.PD 0
.TP 5
.Op \-\-animate ", " \-a
'
Animate multi-image GIFs by default. Normally, multi-image GIFs first
appear in slideshow mode. You can always use the
.RB ` a '
keystroke to toggle between modes. This option has a converse,
.Qo \-\-no\-animate
or
.Qo +a .
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Op \-\-unoptimize ", " \-U
'
Display multi-image GIFs as ``unoptimized'', which shows a faithful
representation of what a user will see at each frame of an animation. See
.BR gifsicle (1)
for a more detailed description of unoptimization. This option has a
converse,
.Qo \-\-no\-unoptimize
or
.Qo +U .
GIFs are always displayed unoptimized in animation mode.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-d display
.TP
.Oa \-\-display display
'
Sets the X display to
.IR display .
This option must come before any GIF files.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-\-name name
'
Sets the application name under which resources are found, rather than
the default of "gifview". Since
.B gifview
itself does not use the resource database, this is mostly useful for
communication with your window manager.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-\-geometry geometry
'
Set the size and position of
.BR gifview 's
windows. This is a standard X option. At most one
.Op \-\-geometry
option can be given per window (that is, per input GIF file).
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-\-title title
'
Sets the
.B gifview
window's title. The default is "gifview", followed by information about the
currently displayed file and frame.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-w window
.TP
.Oa \-\-window window
'
Display the next GIF input in an existing X window, instead of making a new
top-level window. This way, you can use
.B gifview
to display animated GIFs in a window you created with another program. The
.I window
argument should be an integer
.RB ( gifview
will use that window ID)
or `root'
.RB ( gifview
will use the root window).
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-\-new\-window window
'
Display the next GIF input in a new child of an existing X window. This
child window will disappear when
.B gifview
exits. The
.I window
argument should be an integer
.RB ( gifview
will use that window ID)
or `root'
.RB ( gifview
will use the root window).
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Op \-\-install\-colormap ", " \-i
'
Use a private colormap for each window (if you are using a PseudoColor
display). This avoids polluting the existing colormap, and may produce
better results if your colormap is full, but causes annoying colormap
flashing.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-\-background color
.TP
.Oa \-\-bg color
'
Set the background color, which is used
for transparent pixels.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-\-min\-delay delay
'
Set the minimum delay between frames to
.IR delay ,
which is measured in hundredths of a second. Default is 0.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Oa \-\-fallback\-delay delay
'
Set the frame delay of GIFs that do not specify a delay value
or have a delay of 0.
The final value is still subject to the value of \-\-min\-delay.
Like \-\-min\-delay,
.IR delay
is measured in hundredths of a second. Default is 0.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Op \-\-no\-interactive ", " \+e
'
Don't pay attention to mouse buttons or keystrokes.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Op \-\-memory\-limit lim
'
Cache at most
.I lim
megabytes of images in memory when animating. Default is 40.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.Op \-\-help
'
Print usage information and exit.
'
.Sp
.TP
.Op \-\-version
'
Print the version number and some quickie warranty information and exit.
'
.PD

.SS Frame Selections

A frame selection tells
.B gifview
which frame to initially display from the current input file. They are
useful only for animations, as non-animated GIFs only have one frame. Frame
selections can only be displayed in slideshow mode.
.Sp
.PD 0
.TP 13
.BI # num
'
Select frame \fInum\fR. (The first frame is
.Qo #0 .
Negative numbers count backwards from the last frame, which is
.Qo #-1 .)
'
.TP 13
.BI # name
'
Select the frame named \fIname\fR.
.PD
.PP
If you give two or more frame selections, you will get one window per frame
selection.
