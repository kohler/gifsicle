Gifsicle
========
[![TravisCI status](https://travis-ci.com/kohler/gifsicle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kohler/gifsicle)

Gifsicle manipulates GIF image files. Depending on command line
options, it can merge several GIFs into a GIF animation; explode an
animation into its component frames; change individual frames in an
animation; turn interlacing on and off; add transparency; add delays,
disposals, and looping to animations; add and remove comments; flip
and rotate; optimize animations for space; change images' colormaps;
and other things.

Gifview, a companion program, displays GIF images and animations on an
X display. It can display multi-frame GIFs either as slideshows,
displaying one frame at a time, or as real-time animations.

Gifdiff, another companion program, checks two GIF files for identical
visual appearance. This is probably most useful for testing
GIF-manipulating software.

Each of these programs has a manpage, `PROGRAMNAME.1`.

The Gifsicle package comes with NO WARRANTY, express or implied,
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

Building Gifsicle on UNIX
-------------------------

Type `./configure`, then `make`.

If `./configure` does not exist (you downloaded from Github), run
`autoreconf -i` first.

`./configure` accepts the usual options; see `INSTALL` for details.
To build without gifview (for example, if you don't have X11), use
`./configure --disable-gifview`. To build without gifdiff,
use `./configure --disable-gifdiff`.

`make install` will build and install Gifsicle and its manual page
(under /usr/local by default).


Building Gifsicle on Windows
----------------------------

To build Gifsicle on Windows using Visual C, change into the `src`
directory and run

    nmake -f Makefile.w32

Gifview will not be built. The makefile is from Emil Mikulic
<darkmoon@connexus.net.au> with updates by Steven Marthouse
<comments@vrml3d.com>.

To build Gifsicle on Windows using Borland C++, change into the `src`
directory and run

    nmake -f Makefile.bcc

Stephen Schnipsel <schnipsel@m4f.net> provided `Makefile.bcc`. You
will need to edit one of these Makefiles to use a different compiler.
You can edit it with any text editor (like Notepad). See the file for
more information.

React Native (Android and IOS)
------------------------------

you can run gifsicle in **Android** and **IOS** through [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) javascript by using [react-native-gifsicle](https://github.com/numandev1/react-native-gifsicle) npm package.
